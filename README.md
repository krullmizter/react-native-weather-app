# React Native Weather App ðŸŒž

### This is a simple, cross-platform React Native app to demonstrate some of my overall WebDev, AppDev, React, TypeScript, and API knowledge
*Sadly I'm not a graphics designer, so be gentle*

### This app uses:

* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
    * [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
    * [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
    * [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* Free [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
    * Current weather
    * 5-day forecasts
    * Geocoding
* Using Prettier for automatic code formatting

<hr  />

### Setup
Feel free to clone or fork the repo

**Some prerequisite:**
* Node.js (npm comes pre-bundled with Node)
* npm / Yarn `npm install --g yarn`
* expo-cli: `npm install -g expo-cli`

After cloning the repo, just navigate to the root directory, and depending on your setup run either: 
`npm install` or `yarn install`

**Start the Expo app development**
Test and start developing the app by navigating to the root directory, and running: 
`npx expo start` 
<i>Hint. Use the `-c` flag if you want to start the app without cache</i>

### OpenWeatherMap API

If you want to use the OpenWeatherMap API, then you need to head over to their website, sign up and get yourself an API key. They've got a free one that works great for starting off or testing. After you have an account and API key:

* Create an `.env` file in the root directory
* Make sure that the `.env` file is inside your `.gitignore`!
* Paste your API key inside the `.env` file, and name it something cool ðŸ˜Ž
* For example: `WEATHER_API_KEY=1337`

### TODO

Stuff and features I'd like to add or improve

* Caching and overall performance enhancements
* Improved 5-day forecast, more accurate current day forecast
* Improving the UI
    * Implementing better icons and other media
    * Native feedback, such as error messages as alerts/pop-ups, etc.
    * Transition effects
* City search input autofill
* UI/UX app user settings
    * Possible to change different units
* Charts for high and low temperatures
* Adding overall testing, CI/CD, and other development focused tooling
* Redux or alternative state management (if the app grows ðŸ˜Ž)
* Predictions using AI, and/or translations with LLMs ðŸ˜®
