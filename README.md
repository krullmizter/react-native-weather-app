# React Native Weather App ðŸŒž

### This is a simple, cross-platform React Native app to demonstrate some of my overall WebDev, AppDev, React, TypeScript, and API knowledge

#### This website uses:

* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
    * [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
    * [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
    * [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* Free [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

<hr  />

Feel free to fork or clone this repo. Some prerequisite:

* Node.js
* npm or Yarn
* expo-cli `npm install -g expo-cli`

After cloning the repo, just navigate to the root directory, and run either: `npm install` or `yarn install`

Test the app by being in the root directory, and running: `npx expo start` 
Hint. Use the `-c` flag if you want to reload without the cache

#### OpenWeatherMap API

If you want to use the OpenWeatherMap API, then you need to head over to their website, sign up and get yourself an API key. They've got a free one that works great for starting off or testing. After you have an account and API key:

* Create an `.env` file in the root directory
* Make sure that the `.env` file is inside your `.gitignore`!
* Paste your API key inside the `.env` file, and name it something cool ðŸ˜Ž
* For example: `WEATHER_API_KEY=1337`
